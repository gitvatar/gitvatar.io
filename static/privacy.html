		<h1>Privacy</h1>

		<p>
			<strong>gitvatar</strong> does not track you or your activity in <em>any way</em>, period. There's no accounts, no passwords, no cookies, no web analytics, nothing of the sort. Seriously.
		</p>
		<p>
			We <em>only</em> store your uploaded avatar image&mdash;publicly but anonymously, in a <a href="https://github.com/gitvatar/avatars">Github repository</a>&mdash;and store privately a hash of the email address your provide&mdash;unreadable, so not usable by spammers. That's it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since we don't store a readable version of your email address, we cannot and do not use or share your stored email address for contacting you, ever. No one else will ever get your email address from us. The hash of your email address that we store, privately, is only used later to lookup your avatar image when other sites want to display it. It's as simple as that.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you <a href="https://github.com/gitvatar/avatars/issues">contact us</a> to have an avatar image linked to your email address removed, we will verify that you have proper authorization to do so by communicating with you over email, and match (via hash) your email address to the email address linked to the avatar image. At your request, this is <strong>the only email communication</strong> you will ever receive from us.
		</p>
		<p>
			In accordance with best practices for system and network stability and our <a href="/tos">Terms of Service</a>, we monitor the overall health of the system, sans user identities. That means we reserve the right to defend and block any abusive or disruptive behavior, such as mass uploading, excessive downloading, web scraping, denial of service attacks, hacking, etc.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Note:</strong> We're not specifically aware of, nor in control of, the privacy or tracking policies, or Terms of Service, for <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> (where avatar images are ultimately stored and served). Please contact Github for additional information.
