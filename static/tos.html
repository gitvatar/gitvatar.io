		<h1>Terms of Service</h1>

		<p>
			Usage of any part of the <strong>gitvatar</strong> website or <a href="/api">API</a> constitutes acceptance of these Terms of Service.
		</p>
		<p>
			The purpose of <strong>gitvatar</strong> is to store an avatar image of yourself to use to represent your identity around the internet. You should only use <strong>gitvatar</strong> for that purpose. This is not a general image hosting service.
		</p>
		<p>
			All avatar images uploaded to <strong>gitvatar</strong> must be G-rated and be a generally recognizable picture (photo or artwork) of the person it represents. While many people prefer to use otherwise unrecognizable, anonymous graphic representations of themselves online, for artistic or privacy reasons, the <strong>gitvatar</strong> service is intended to share a recognizable likeness of yourself online for others. Use <strong>gitvatar</strong> accordingly.
		</p>
		<p>
			If it would be appropriate to display on your LinkedIn profile, Facebook profile, Twitter profile, online resume, or G-rated personal blog or internet forum, then it's OK to share via <strong>gitvatar</strong>. That means <strong>no</strong> pornography, nudity, or otherwise socially unacceptable images&mdash;basically <strong>anything not suitable</strong> to share with children&mdash;are allowed.
		</p>
		<p>
			If a group or business uses the <strong>gitvatar</strong> service, the avatar image must be a generally recognizable representation of that group or business's brand or online identity. The above rules on G-rated acceptability apply.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since we do not track or verify the owner or identity of any email address, we make <strong>no guarantees of any sort</strong> as to whether an avatar image actually or fairly represents the person or entity associated with an email address.
		</p>
		<p>
			We cannot and do not check whether someone is authorized to upload an avatar image as a representation of the person or entity associated with an email address. For the same reason, we cannot and do not allow automated removal of any avatar. If your email address or avatar image have been used with this service without your consent, please <a href="https://github.com/gitvatar/avatars/issues">contact us</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Only the URL for the most recent upload of an avatar image associated with an email address will be returned by the API (and thus used by other websites). As such, if you wish to "replace" an avatar image with a different one, just upload a new avatar image using the same email address. Please note that in this case, previous avatar image(s) are not actually deleted, and any cached copy of the URL that points to those previous avatar image(s) will continue to operate.
		</p>
		<p>
			We make no guarantees of any sort as to the availability of avatar images. The avatar images are hosted and served from <a href="https://github.com">Github</a>, which is in control of their availability, at their sole discretion.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>gitvatar</strong> does not materially edit the substance of uploaded avatar images, except for reasonable and necessary modifications, including at our sole discretion: cropping (to a square aspect ratio), resizing dimensions, downsampling quality to reduce file size, etc.
		</p>
		<p>
			As stated in our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, we do not specifically track any person's usage of this service. However, to ensure that the service remains available for all internet users, we reserve the right to monitor our service for abusive (harmful to the service or others) behavior, and respond accordingly, including blocking the source of the abusive behavior, removing any content that is deemed to violate these <em>Terms of Service</em>, etc.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please <strong>do not abuse</strong> the site or API with excessive requests. As a general rule, excessive usage would be more than 5 uploads, or 100 avatar image URL lookups, per minute. There is no formal rate limiting applied at the moment, but abusers will be limited or blocked. If you have a legitimate need tht may exceed these limits, please <a href="https://github.com/gitvatar/avatars/issues">contact us</a>. <strong>NOTE:</strong> If your site is displaying avatar images, URL lookups should be cached on your side (for at least 24 hours&mdash;preferably longer!); this will likely prevent going over the excessive usage limits for those requests.
		</p>
		<p>
			As <strong>gitvatar</strong> stores and serves user-generated content in the form of avatar images that are publicly accessible, we are expected by various legal authorities around the world to ensure that any images we serve do not violate any applicable laws, including copyrighted material, illegal imagery like child pornography, etc. We are required to respond to any official reports of content in our system violating any of these laws; our response will be to immediately and permanently remove the content in question.
		</p>
		<p>
			We ultimately reserve the right to permanently remove any avatar image from our system, at our discretion, if we find it violates any part of these <em>Terms of Service</em>. Since we never store anything about your identity, nor do we keep a readable/usable version of your email address, we <strong>cannot and will not</strong> contact you if an image is removed, unless the the removal was <a href="https://github.com/gitvatar/avatars/issues">at your request</a>.
