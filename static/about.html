			<strong>gitvatar</strong>: ('gi-vah-tahr)&mdash;the first "t" is silent.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>gitvatar</strong> is like <a href="https://gravatar.com">Gravatar</a> (<em>G</em>lobally <em>R</em>ecognized Avatars), except the uploaded avatar images are stored in a public <a href="https://github.com/gitvatar/avatars">Github repository</a>. Each uploaded avatar image is uniquely and permanently identified by its own Git commit hash.
		</p>
		<p>
			Don't worry, though. Your email address is <strong>not stored in the public repository</strong> in any way, only your avatar image. Your email address is only stored privately by our service, and only in hashed format&mdash;thus unreadable and unusable by spammers! For more information, see our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> and our <a href="/tos">Terms of Service</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Avatar images are served through Github's <strong>raw.githubusercontent.com</strong> CDN service.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>gitvatar</strong>'s <a href="/api">API</a> supports both uploading and viewing of avatar images. This makes <strong>gitvatar</strong> a little more flexible/powerful for developers to integrate into their applications than something like Gravatar.
